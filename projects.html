                <h3>A Novel Approach to Endoscopic Surgeon Action Detection with STN, EfficientNet-B2 with FPN</h3>
                <p>Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is a specialized medical technique crucial for delicate procedures, often involving a primary surgeon and an assistant. The success of MIS hinges on various factors, including the surgeon's concentration, skills, teamwork, and other critical aspects. However, such procedures carry inherent risks, prompting the exploration of technologies to mitigate human error. Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a pivotal role in enhancing precision and efficiency in high-stakes applications. Robotic minimally invasive surgery (RMIS) integrates AI algorithms with robotic arms to conduct surgeries remotely, minimizing patient trauma. The ESAD (Endoscopic Surgeon Activity Detection) dataset represents a significant advancement in addressing the challenge of identifying and monitoring surgeon activities during endoscopic MIS procedures. By compiling a comprehensive dataset, ESAD enables researchers to develop and validate AI algorithms capable of recognizing and analyzing surgeon actions in real-time. This dataset facilitates the creation of AI-powered systems that can assist surgeons during procedures, enhance training programs, and improve overall patient outcomes. In essence, ESAD serves as a foundational resource for advancing the field of RMIS and promoting safer, more efficient surgical practices.</p>

                <h3>Kidney Tumor Detection and Classification</h3>
                <p>This project focuses on the detection and classification of kidney tumors. Utilizing advanced imaging techniques and machine learning algorithms, the system can accurately identify the presence of kidney tumors and determine their stage and type. Early and precise detection is crucial for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. The project integrates a comprehensive dataset of kidney tumor images, enabling the development and validation of robust AI models. These models assist radiologists in diagnosing and planning treatment strategies, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of medical interventions.</p>

                <h3>PDF Chatbot</h3>
                <p>The "PDF Chatbot" project aims to create an intelligent system that enhances user interaction with PDF documents. Users can upload PDFs and pose questions, to which the system responds with accurate answers derived from the document's content. The core technologies include a BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model for question answering and Particle Swarm Optimization to locate the most relevant text within the document. Additionally, the system augments responses by providing relevant external resources, such as Google search results and YouTube videos, to offer a comprehensive understanding of the queried topic. This integration of AI techniques ensures a robust and user-friendly tool for extracting and expanding knowledge from static PDF documents.</p>

                <h3>Deep Fake Image Detection using Deep Learning Models</h3>
                <p>The "Deep Fake Image Detection using Deep Learning Models" project addresses the growing challenge of identifying deep fake images, which are digitally manipulated to create hyper-realistic but fake visuals. This project employs state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, including InceptionResNetV2 and EfficientNet, to develop a robust detection system. These models are trained to recognize subtle inconsistencies and artifacts in images that indicate manipulation. The goal is to provide a highly accurate tool for detecting deep fakes, thereby contributing to the integrity and security of digital media. The application of these advanced models ensures the system's effectiveness in distinguishing between genuine and altered images, making it a valuable asset in combating misinformation and enhancing digital trust.</p>
